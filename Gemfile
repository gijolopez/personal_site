#Capybara allows us to test how our apps look in a web browser.
#Launchy allows us to stop in the middle of a test to see what is currently showing on our web page (using the command save_and_open_page).
#Rack is the gem we're going to use to allow us to receive HTTP requests and send HTTP responses.
